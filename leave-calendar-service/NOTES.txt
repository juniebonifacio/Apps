Database Modeling:

Credits to the owner. I am loosely basing my database with the sample.
http://www.databaseanswers.org/data_models/employees/index.htm

A. Planning your database:

	1. What's the point?
	- This database is to support the Leave Calendar App that will make it easier for the team lead.
	
	2. What do you have already?
	Physical items ie. Forms - None.
	
	People and expertise - me
	
	Existing database - none
	
	3. What Entities do you have?
	
	
	- you will create separate tables for each entity.
	- use Singular nouns for your table names.
	- check the relationships of those entities.


	Therefore, list of entities (which will be the table names):
		User
		Role
		TimeOff
		

Error:
leave-calendar-service threw exception: org.hibernate.hql.internal.ast.QuerySyntaxException: TimeOffVO is not mapped [FROM TimeOffVO]
Solution: 
Edit the file persistence.xml under  src/main/webapp/META-INF, not the one under the src main java
